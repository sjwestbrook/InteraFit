    <h1>Anxiety</h1>
    <p>Anxiety is a normal human emotion that everyone experiences at times. Many people feel anxious, nervous, or upset, when faced with a problem or stressful event. Anxiety disorders are different from this basic, “every day” anxiety, however, as they can cause such great distress in a person’s daily functioning that it interferes with their ability to lead a normal, healthy, and productive life.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important to understand anxiety with relation to health and fitness?</h3>
    <p>Anxiety can be a positive factor in your health and well-being, so long as it is a “healthy dose” of anxiety. Anxiety can help you feel motivated to make positive change or maintain healthy behaviors already in place (e.g., beginning or sticking to a program to stop smoking). However, anxiety in larger, overwhelming doses can have very negative effects on your health and well-being. You may feel so pressured to make change that you end up getting in your own way, trying to do too many things at once or working toward unrealistic goals. Additionally, you may feel anxious about beginning something new (e.g., changing job, increasing physical activity, signing up for a college course, etc.) and will struggle to get past this and actually begin it (what if I can’t do it, what if I don’t stick with it, what if I don’t like my instructor). Anxiety can shut a person down to where they don’t have motivation to change or try something new at all. Research has shown that the cerebral cortex part of the brain in anxious and depressed people is shut down to a large degree. This affects memory, concentration and decision making.  It also affects motivation and very often those with anxiety suffer from “brain fog”. </p>

    <h1>TIPS &amp; EXERCISES</h1>
    <h3>Some tips on how to manage anxiety</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Acceptance. A certain level of anxiety is normal when dealing with change. Some people have a much harder time than others with change. If you are one of those, look at change as the only constant in life and as a grand adventure. Accept anxiety and try to use it as a motivator rather than a hindrance.</li>
      <li>Breath. Research has shown that deep breathing is very effective at reducing anxiety. For those who enjoy meditation, this is also an effective way of reducing anxiety.</li>
      <li>Commit. Set realistic goals and commit to working toward them. Prioritize the things in your life that you value the most.</li>
      <li>Stay positive. Try to push your worry thoughts away and focus your attention on the positive things you are doing to work toward your goals. Don’t let yourself get caught in small bumps in the road (e.g., didn’t get a project done for work on time or smoked a few cigarettes).</li>
      <li>Identify. Pay attention to where your anxiety is coming from if you can. Are there particular aspects of your life that seem especially anxiety provoking (e.g., relationships, starting a new job, getting out of your comfort zone?). Write down the things about each area of your life that is anxiety provoking. Be aware of what it is causing you anxiety.  </li>
      <li>Let go. Remind yourself that what you are doing now is what matters and that history does not have to repeat itself. Letting go is an important piece of decreasing anxiety. Often people will focus on things from the past (e.g., diets that have failed, relationships that didn’t work out, lost opportunities at work). Try to remember the Serenity Prayer: Please grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. We cannot change the past; don’t let it overtake your present.</li>
      <li>Exercise. In addition to being a necessary element of health and fitness, exercise is a good tool for anxiety reduction. Try to use your gym time as a way to achieve multiple goals at once (e.g., reduce anxiety while working toward fitness goals).</li>
      <li>Journal. Journaling has been shown to be particularly effective in reducing anxiety.</li>
      <li>Worry Hour. Set aside special time to let your anxiety and worry run wild. Start with one hour a day. This is your worry hour. Try your best not to let yourself focus on worrying and anxiety during the rest of the day, only in this one hour of dedicated time.</li>
      <li>Support. Get help and support for your anxiety. You can talk to loved ones about your anxiety, your doctor, or your religious leader. If you are uncomfortable talking to these people or feel that your anxiety is too bad, engage in counseling. There are many effective treatments for anxiety including a variety of talk therapies, group therapies and medications</li>
