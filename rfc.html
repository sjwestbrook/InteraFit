    <h1>Readiness for Change</h1>
    <p>Change is a complex process, which depends on an individual’s awareness of the need for change and their desire to make change. This process also can be heavily influenced by an individual’s emotional state. If someone is having problems with depression, hopelessness, anxiety, or experiencing high levels of stress, this may negatively impact their ability to effectively create change in their lives. Additionally, if someone is struggling with poor body image or poor self-esteem, making changes related to health and fitness can seem especially challenging. </p>
    <p>The change process is thought of in terms of stages, where the stages represent specific groupings of attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors related to an individual’s readiness in the cycle of change. Change is a phenomenon that unfolds over time and each stage reflects not only a period of time but also a set of tasks required for movement to the next stage. Although the time an individual spends in each stage varies, the tasks to be accomplished are assumed to be consistent and stable across most. Change unfolds over a series of five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important to understand the stages of change with relation to health &amp; fitness?</h3>
    <p>Making and maintaining change is a critical part of reaching health and wellness goals. Your readiness for change and desire to make change is one of the most important elements in determining whether or not you will successfully reach these goals. Understanding the stages of change and which stage you are in, helps you to better understand your next steps.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Pre-contemplation Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>When you are in the pre-contemplation stage of change, you have no plans to make changes in your life in the foreseeable future. Many individuals in this stage are unaware or under-aware of any problems or areas for improvement. As G.K. Chesterton once said, “It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. It is that they can’t see the problem.” Families, friends, neighbors, co-workers, or others close to you, however, are often well aware that there are problems that need addressing. When people in this stage first go to the gym, to therapy, to the doctor’s office, etc., they are often doing so because of pressure from others. You may feel tricked, coerced, or pressured into changing by others who threaten you (e.g., a spouse will leave, you will lose your job, etc.). Because you have not been considering making changes in the near future, it is likely that you have not been engaging in any change-activity (activities that progress you toward changes you may want in the future). In order for you to successfully progress and move forward, you will need to acknowledge and “own” the problem(s), whatever they may be, increase your awareness and understanding of the negative aspects of the problem and how it is impacting your life, and evaluate how and why change could be a positive thing for you. </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the pre-contemplation stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Acknowledge that making change is hard and praise yourself for your effort, no matter your motivation for going to the gym, changing jobs, etc. No matter how small the changes are, keep up the habit, even if you don’t feel it is necessary right now. </li>
      <li>Engage in self-exploration and be honest with yourself about your health, wellness and fitness. Are there areas for improvement? Could you stand to be in better shape? Would improving your health and fitness be a positive thing to do? Are there things standing in the way of improving your health—any roadblocks—and if so, what are they and is there anything you can do to remove them?  Journaling is a great way to practice self-exploration. Get a journal, notebook, or even just a few sheets of paper and write notes about all of this. Remember, no one needs to see this journal, so be honest with yourself and don’t hold back.</li>
      <li>In addition to self-exploration about health and fitness specifically, complete a self-exploration exercise related to your emotional and mental health, as these can have a considerable impact on your ability to successfully make change in your life. Are you experiencing depression, anxiety, or high levels of stress? Do you have poor body image or a low self-esteem? If you answered yes to any of these and/or if you have other mental health concerns, you may want to consider seeking help with these from a psychologist or other mental health professional.</li>
      <li>Make a thoughtful list of the pros and cons associated with improving your health. Include diet, exercise, general health, well-being, emotional health, physical appearance, self esteem, body image, and other areas that relate to your health and fitness. Critically evaluate each point and be honest with yourself. This can be a challenging task at this stage as you may have little motivation to make change, but try your best. <br />
        <img src="" alt="" /></li>
      <li>Acknowledge and accept that you may be in denial about your health and fitness. Many people are in denial over things that they need to change because it is often easier to deny that there is a problem than to have to work at fixing it. Work at accepting your current level of health and fitness, no matter where that is, and then consider the best steps to move forward and make positive changes. Remember that acceptance does not mean approval—just because you accept your current health and fitness level, this does not mean you are saying you think your levels are good just as they are. Acceptance gives you the power to move forward, rather than remaining in a stuck point unable to progress successfully.</li>
      <li>Enlist a support group – family member, coach, friend. Discuss any positive things you have noticed since beginning your change process as this can be a great way to reinforce your hard work and will keep you motivated to continue on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Understanding the Contemplation Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>In the contemplation stage of change, people are aware that a problem exists and are seriously thinking about overcoming it but have not yet made a commitment to take action. Serious consideration of problem resolution is the central element of contemplation.</p>
    <p>Example of Contemplation State: <br />
      A man was walking home one evening when a stranger approached him and asked him about the location of a certain street. After readily understanding and accepting the instructions, the stranger began to walk in the opposite direction. The man said, “You are headed in the wrong direction, it’s this way.” The stranger replied, “Yes, I know. I am not quite ready yet.” This is contemplation: knowing where you want to go, but not being quite ready to go there. If you are in the contemplation stage, you are evaluating and considering your options. You may do this for a long period of time but to move forward in the cycle of change, you must avoid the trap of obsessive rumination and make a firm decision to begin to take action. Small “baby steps” of preliminary action lead into the next stage. 
    </p>
    <p>If you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or high levels of stress, it may seem overwhelming to seriously consider making change, or you may struggle to believe that you can be successful in making needed changes. Poor body image and low self-esteem can have similar influence. </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the contemplation stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Praise yourself for your hard work, no matter how small the changes you have been making. Baby steps are okay and are a very positive thing. Remain motivated by being positive.</li>
      <li>Work at building up your confidence and belief in yourself! (For graphic – Build up your confidence and believe in yourself). Motivation theory notes that people don’t engage in behaviors they don’t believe they will be able to do or maintain successfully. Think of the “Little Engine that Could” story… if you think you can, you can. Believe in yourself! Visualize yourself in a more positive way. Visualize yourself with the body you want, feeling good, being healthy, and having the level of fitness you want; generally being happy and confident. </li>
      <li>Avoid “all or nothing” or “black and white” thinking. Don’t become discouraged if you miss a day at the gym or mess up your nutrition plan for a day. One day isn’t the end of the world; just try to get back on track tomorrow and know that you are working hard to make positive changes.</li>
      <li>Seriously evaluate and consider your options for health and fitness, including exercise, nutrition, and any other related factors (for example, any medical care or mental health care that would likely improve your chances of being successful in making the changes you are considering). Are you experiencing depression, anxiety, or high levels of stress? Do you have poor body image or a low self-esteem? If you answered yes to any of these and/or if you have other mental health concerns, you may want to consider seeking help with these from a psychologist or other mental health professional. (Insert link to self-esteem module) (Body Image, stress, depression, anxiety assessment) Do you have pain anywhere in your body, need an asthma inhaler, or have other medical concerns that should be addressed before you undertake a serious change to your physical health and fitness regimen? If you answered yes to any of these, you should schedule an appointment with a medical doctor.</li>
      <li>Don’t let little roadblocks keep you (stay) stuck or make you feel like you can’t progress. Sometimes people in the contemplation stage of change get stuck over little things that are easy to overcome (e.g., you don’t like to run and when you think about having to do a cardio workout at the gym, you only think about the treadmill and running).  Figure out an exercise regimen that doesn’t include running.  It is highly likely that there is an option or alternative that will work for you.</li>
      <li>Don’t let bumps in the road discourage you from reaching your goals. Sometimes when people are faced with unexpected and unfortunate events (a break-up, financial trouble, serious illness or death of a loved one, etc) they feel so consumed by these things that they lose sight of many other important things in their lives. New habits and goals, like starting a new health and fitness routine, would likely be on the top of the list that could be easily pushed to the side. Try your best not to let this happen. Also, keep in mind that exercise is a great way to improve your mood and brighten your spirits! Medical doctors, psychologists, and other professionals often prescribe exercise to people as a way to improve their mood, combat depression and anxiety, and improve well-being. If you are feeling down, upset or stressed, exercise! This will help you feel better emotionally and will also help you toward your health and wellness goals. </li>
      <li>Try to be open-minded. In this stage, you are still ‘on the fence’ about whether or not you really want to put in the effort to make changes. You go back and forth, evaluating the pros and cons. Try to be reasonable, logical, open to feedback from others, and most of all, “don’t knock it before you try it.”</li>
      <li>Create a support team. Discuss your health goals with loved ones, your coach, or others who will be a good support system for you (including friends on social media). For some people, verbalizing their goals to others is a good way to build in some extra personal accountability. Not only will you potentially feel accountable to follow through with your goals, but you will get support and encouragement from people who care about you as you work toward goals. </li>

    <h3>Understanding the Preparation Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>In the preparation stage of change, people begin to combine intention and behavioral changes. Individuals intend to take action immediately and report some small behavioral changes, such as smoking five fewer cigarettes per day, going to the gym for 20 minutes, or reducing their portion sizes or caloric intake. Although they have made some reductions in their problem behaviors, individuals in the preparation stage have not yet reached a criterion for effective action, such as significantly cutting down on junk food. They are intending, however, to take such action in the very near future. If an individual is struggling with depression, anxiety, stress, body image, poor self esteem or other mental health concerns, these have likely subsided at least slightly if the person has been able to move into preparation. </p>

  <div>
    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the preparation stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the Preparation Stage of Change, you feel like you are really ready to make a change and are starting to gear up to make this happen. Continue to acknowledge the hard work you are doing and be happy with your progress.</li>
      <li>Mental Health Concerns</li>
      <li>If you have been able to progress to the preparation stage of change, it is likely that any depression, anxiety, stress, poor body image, low self esteem or other mental health concerns have subsided somewhat, but it is critical that you continue to work on your total well being. Be aware that these things can ebb and flow a little and that you may have good and bad days. Continue to believe in yourself and do your best. Keep in mind that exercise is a great way to combat many mental health concerns.</li>
      <li>Really work at building up your confidence and belief in yourself. Motivation theory notes that people don’t engage in behaviors they don’t believe they will be able to do or maintain successfully. Think of the “Little Engine that Could” story… if you think you can, you can. Believe that you can be successful in reaching your health and wellness goals. BELIEVE in yourself! BELIEVE in your ability to reach your goals! BELIEVE that you can do anything you set your mind to!</li>
      <li>Evaluate what needs to happen to make it as easy as possible for you to make these changes. What are your obstacles currently? What is keeping you from making these changes? Do all that you can to address these concerns and remove as many potential roadblocks as possible.</li>
      <li>Baby steps are a good thing and sometimes the best thing during this stage of change. Don’t try to take on too much at first. It is common for people to overwhelm themselves initially when they decide to make changes to their health and wellness (e.g., I’m going to cut my calories to 1200 starting tomorrow and get up every morning to run a mile, plus I’m going to get rid of all of the stress in my life now, and… and… and…). Take it slow and easy. This will make things easier to maintain. If you pile on everything all at once, you are setting yourself up for disappointment when you can’t keep up. </li>
      <li>Create a support system and work with them to make a list of concrete priorities and goals. These should include not only your health and fitness goals, but also all personal priorities and goals in your life. Go over these goals and really evaluate each one. It is sometimes best to break each goal into more manageable components by setting both short and long term goals. Explore how health and fitness influence your other goals (e.g., family, friends, career, travel).</li>

    <h3>Understanding the Action Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>In the action stage of change, individuals change their behavior, experiences and/or environment in order to overcome their problems. Action involves the most apparent behavioral changes and requires a considerable commitment of time and energy. Modifications of a problem made in the action stage tend to be most visible and receive the greatest external recognition. People, often erroneously equate action with change and as a consequence overlook the requisite work that prepares changers for action and the important efforts necessary to maintain the changes following action. Individuals are classified as being in the action stage if they have successfully altered a problem behavior for a period of 1 day to 6 months.   </p>    
    <p><img src="" alt="" /></p>
    <p>Successfully altering a problem behavior means reaching a specific criterion, such as consistent exercise or abstinence from alcohol/drugs. Modification of the target behavior to an acceptable criterion and significant efforts to change are all the hallmarks of action. People in the action stage may struggle with reverting to old habits as they work to adopt and implement healthier more productive habits. They become aware of the pitfalls that might undermine continued action, whether these are cognitive, behavioral, emotional, or environmental in nature. In this way, they will create effective strategies to prevent lapses or slips from becoming complete relapses. At this stage people likely have a high level of motivation and are doing the work for themselves, rather than because they feel pressure from others. Additionally, once someone has reached the action stage, it is likely that, if they were struggling with any depression, anxiety, stress, body image, poor self-esteem or other mental health concerns that these have subsided at least slightly. </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the action stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>This is it! You are doing the work now and are making the changes. Congratulations! Keep up the good work. This is a critical stage as you have done all the hard work to get here, to make the changes possible and to get started with them. Dedicate yourself to the work and to the change process.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind all the reasons you want to change, all the positives you came up with in previous stages, all the reasons you want to improve your health and fitness, and focus on the goal. Stay dedicated to your goals and you will see results sooner than you expect!</li>
      <li>Be aware of any positive changes you see in your health, fitness, and body, but also notice if you feel any different with respect to depression, anxiety, stress, body image, self-esteem or other mental health concerns. Exercise is a great way to improve your mental health and it is highly likely that you will see positive changes in these areas as well. Keep any and all positive changes and improvements in mind to help keep you motivated and on track.</li>
      <li>Believe in yourself and your ability to reach your goals successfully!</li>
      <li>Focus on your strengths and the progress you are making, even if it seems very slow at times. Stay positive! Don’t worry about being perfect; just do your best. </li>
      <li>Visualization  (Visualize) can be a helpful exercise in this stage as you try to imagine yourself as more healthy and happy.  What will you look like? How will you feel? How will the improved you change your life? Try to visualize all of these things. Focus on the positive changes you want to make and try to see yourself working on these and making them happen. Turn your dreams and wishes into reality!</li>
      <li>Practice positive self-talk. Positive self-talk means thinking to yourself, or even saying out loud, positive affirmations about your progress. This can be very specific (e.g., “I am so close to being able to wear that dress from freshman year!”) to more broad (e.g., “I am feeling better about myself!”). Do not give in to negative self-talk… keep positive!</li>
      <li>Keep up your motivation! Give yourself little rewards as you reach each milestone or little goal (e.g., After you have successfully kept up your fitness routine for one week, reward yourself with a favorite activity. After you have not consumed alcohol for a week, give yourself a special treat.) Note: the treat can be anything you want… a bit of your favorite food, a new piece of clothing, a trip to the movies, whatever you like.</li>
      <li>Evaluate what is going well for you and keep these activities in your life. </li>
      <li>Be very positive and happy with your progress, but be careful in this stage not to become overly confident in your progress. A problem many people face in this stage is that they work very hard for the first week or first month and do well so think that they have overcome all their roadblocks and will forever be able to maintain these changes. However, they then gradually (or for some, all at once) start regressing back to old habits or start feeling like they have been doing so well, it is alright if they skip their workout just this once. This is a slippery slope and this is the time it is critical that you stay focused and dedicated and don’t let your guard down!</li>
      <li>Use Support System. Work with your support group to keep your measurable and reasonable goals. It is common when you are being successful in this stage that you want to significantly increase your efforts. You may find yourself feeling overwhelmed if you do this, which could lead you to break the positive habits you are building. Continue to build on the habits you have for a while, before you add anything new or extra.</li>
    </ol>

  <div>
    <h3>Understanding the Maintenance Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>In the maintenance stage of change, people work to prevent relapse (reverting to hold habits) and to consolidate the gains attained during the action phase. Traditionally, maintenance has been viewed as a static stage; however, maintenance is a continuation, not an absence, of change. For chronic problems, this stage extends 6 months to an indeterminate period past the initial action. For some behaviors, maintenance can be considered to last a lifetime. For many, this will be the case for health and fitness— changes will be something that one must attend to for their entire life. Being able to remain free of the chronic problem and/or to consistently engage in a new compatible behavior for more than 6 months is the criterion for considering someone to be in the maintenance stage. Stabilizing behavior and avoiding relapse are the cardinal signs of being in the maintenance stage.</p>

  <div>
    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the maintenance stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Relapse is the rule, not the exception for problems related to health and wellness. It is important to note that few people successfully reach and stay in the maintenance stage on their first attempt; in fact, many more people do not make it on their first attempt than do. Try not to feel overly discouraged or down if you revert back a stage or two, overeat or engage in other unhealthy behaviors. This is perfectly normal. Motivate yourself to get back on track and do your best.</li>
      <li>Know that dedicating oneself to health and wellness is a lifelong commitment. After 6 months +/- of training and consistent follow through with nutrition. Strategies for good mental health and exercise routines, some people will be fully in the habit and need only a little encouragement to continue this work on their own; whereas others will need more support, supervision and training. No matter which of these groups you fall into, accept where you are and what you need to succeed and do it. Remember you have made the changes you wanted; now you are just working to maintain them.</li>
      <li>Try to diversify your life to keep yourself interested and motivated. Try new activities dealing with the changes you’re making, new meals, even possibly try things like running a 5K, etc.</li>
      <li>Stay motivated and keep positive by revisiting all the positive changes and improvements you have seen in your life since beginning to work on your health and wellness goals. Do not be surprised if the positive things you notice include not only things specifically related to health and fitness, but also improved mental health, improved relationships, improved performance at work or school and so on. Improved health and fitness can have profound effects on all areas of life and well-being.</li>
      <li>Remind yourself regularly of all the reasons you made these changes, all the positive reasons you came up with in previous stages, all the reasons you wanted to improve your health and fitness, and focus yourself on maintaining your goal.</li>
      <li>Practice positive self-talk. Positive self-talk means thinking to yourself, or even saying out loud, positive affirmations about your progress toward your health and fitness goals. This can be very specific (e.g., “I am so close to being able to wear that dress from freshman year!”) to more broad (e.g., “I am feeling better about myself!”). Do not give in to negative self-talk… keep positive! </li>
      <li>Visualization can be a helpful exercise in this stage as you try to imagine yourself as a more healthy and happier person. What will you look like? How will you feel? How will improved health change your life? Try to visualize all of these things. Focus on the positive changes you want to make and try to see yourself working on these and making them happen. Turn your dreams and wishes into reality!</li>
      <li>Pay attention to yourself and make sure that you haven’t fallen into a “nothing is ever enough” mindset (e.g., you have met your original health and fitness goals, but now have set new goals for further weight loss or other things). So long as these new goals are still reasonable and healthy, that is fine; however, you should discuss your new goals with your support system to ensure that they are reasonable and healthy.</li>
