    <h1>Readiness for Change</h1>
    <p>Change is a complex process, which depends on an individual’s awareness of the need for change and their desire to make change. This process also can be heavily influenced by an individual’s emotional state. If someone is having problems with depression, hopelessness, anxiety, or experiencing high levels of stress, this may negatively impact their ability to effectively create change in their lives. Additionally, if someone is struggling with poor body image or poor self-esteem, making changes related to health and fitness can seem especially challenging. </p>
    <p>The change process is thought of in terms of stages, where the stages represent specific groupings of attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors related to an individual’s readiness in the cycle of change. Change is a phenomenon that unfolds over time and each stage reflects not only a period of time but also a set of tasks required for movement to the next stage. Although the time an individual spends in each stage varies, the tasks to be accomplished are assumed to be consistent and stable across most. Change unfolds over a series of five stages: precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important to understand the stages of change with relation to health &amp; fitness?</h3>
    <p>Making and maintaining change is a critical part of reaching health and wellness goals. Your readiness for change and desire to make change is one of the most important elements in determining whether or not you will successfully reach these goals. Understanding the stages of change and which stage you are in, helps you to better understand your next steps.</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Pre-contemplation Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>When you are in the pre-contemplation stage of change, you have no plans to make changes in your life in the foreseeable future. Many individuals in this stage are unaware or under-aware of any problems or areas for improvement. As G.K. Chesterton once said, “It isn’t that they can’t see the solution. It is that they can’t see the problem.” Families, friends, neighbors, co-workers, or others close to you, however, are often well aware that there are problems that need addressing. When people in this stage first go to the gym, to therapy, to the doctor’s office, etc., they are often doing so because of pressure from others. You may feel tricked, coerced, or pressured into changing by others who threaten you (e.g., a spouse will leave, you will lose your job, etc.). Because you have not been considering making changes in the near future, it is likely that you have not been engaging in any change-activity (activities that progress you toward changes you may want in the future). In order for you to successfully progress and move forward, you will need to acknowledge and “own” the problem(s), whatever they may be, increase your awareness and understanding of the negative aspects of the problem and how it is impacting your life, and evaluate how and why change could be a positive thing for you. </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the pre-contemplation stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Acknowledge that making change is hard and praise yourself for your effort, no matter your motivation for going to the gym, changing jobs, etc. No matter how small the changes are, keep up the habit, even if you don’t feel it is necessary right now. </li>
      <li>Engage in self-exploration and be honest with yourself about your health, wellness and fitness. Are there areas for improvement? Could you stand to be in better shape? Would improving your health and fitness be a positive thing to do? Are there things standing in the way of improving your health—any roadblocks—and if so, what are they and is there anything you can do to remove them?  Journaling is a great way to practice self-exploration. Get a journal, notebook, or even just a few sheets of paper and write notes about all of this. Remember, no one needs to see this journal, so be honest with yourself and don’t hold back.</li>
      <li>In addition to self-exploration about health and fitness specifically, complete a self-exploration exercise related to your emotional and mental health, as these can have a considerable impact on your ability to successfully make change in your life. Are you experiencing depression, anxiety, or high levels of stress? Do you have poor body image or a low self-esteem? If you answered yes to any of these and/or if you have other mental health concerns, you may want to consider seeking help with these from a psychologist or other mental health professional.</li>
      <li>Make a thoughtful list of the pros and cons associated with improving your health. Include diet, exercise, general health, well-being, emotional health, physical appearance, self esteem, body image, and other areas that relate to your health and fitness. Critically evaluate each point and be honest with yourself. This can be a challenging task at this stage as you may have little motivation to make change, but try your best. <br />
        <img src="" alt="" /></li>
      <li>Acknowledge and accept that you may be in denial about your health and fitness. Many people are in denial over things that they need to change because it is often easier to deny that there is a problem than to have to work at fixing it. Work at accepting your current level of health and fitness, no matter where that is, and then consider the best steps to move forward and make positive changes. Remember that acceptance does not mean approval—just because you accept your current health and fitness level, this does not mean you are saying you think your levels are good just as they are. Acceptance gives you the power to move forward, rather than remaining in a stuck point unable to progress successfully.</li>
      <li>Enlist a support group – family member, coach, friend. Discuss any positive things you have noticed since beginning your change process as this can be a great way to reinforce your hard work and will keep you motivated to continue on.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Understanding the Contemplation Stage of Change</h3>
    <p>In the contemplation stage of change, people are aware that a problem exists and are seriously thinking about overcoming it but have not yet made a commitment to take action. Serious consideration of problem resolution is the central element of contemplation.</p>
    <p>Example of Contemplation State: <br />
      A man was walking home one evening when a stranger approached him and asked him about the location of a certain street. After readily understanding and accepting the instructions, the stranger began to walk in the opposite direction. The man said, “You are headed in the wrong direction, it’s this way.” The stranger replied, “Yes, I know. I am not quite ready yet.” This is contemplation: knowing where you want to go, but not being quite ready to go there. If you are in the contemplation stage, you are evaluating and considering your options. You may do this for a long period of time but to move forward in the cycle of change, you must avoid the trap of obsessive rumination and make a firm decision to begin to take action. Small “baby steps” of preliminary action lead into the next stage. 
    </p>
    <p>If you are experiencing depression, anxiety, or high levels of stress, it may seem overwhelming to seriously consider making change, or you may struggle to believe that you can be successful in making needed changes. Poor body image and low self-esteem can have similar influence. </p>

    <h3>Strategies for Change</h3>
    <p>Some tips on how to manage being in the contemplation stage and how to progress to the next stage of change.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Praise yourself for your hard work, no matter how small the changes you have been making. Baby steps are okay and are a very positive thing. Remain motivated by being positive.</li>
      <li>Work at building up your confidence and belief in yourself! (For graphic – Build up your confidence and believe in yourself). Motivation theory notes that people don’t engage in behaviors they don’t believe they will be able to do or maintain successfully. Think of the “Little Engine that Could” story… if you think you can, you can. Believe in yourself! Visualize yourself in a more positive way. Visualize yourself with the body you want, feeling good, being healthy, and having the level of fitness you want; generally being happy and confident. </li>
      <li>Avoid “all or nothing” or “black and white” thinking. Don’t become discouraged if you miss a day at the gym or mess up your nutrition plan for a day. One day isn’t the end of the world; just try to get back on track tomorrow and know that you are working hard to make positive changes.</li>
      <li>Seriously evaluate and consider your options for health and fitness, including exercise, nutrition, and any other related factors (for example, any medical care or mental health care that would likely improve your chances of being successful in making the changes you are considering). Are you experiencing depression, anxiety, or high levels of stress? Do you have poor body image or a low self-esteem? If you answered yes to any of these and/or if you have other mental health concerns, you may want to consider seeking help with these from a psychologist or other mental health professional. (Insert link to self-esteem module) (Body Image, stress, depression, anxiety assessment) Do you have pain anywhere in your body, need an asthma inhaler, or have other medical concerns that should be addressed before you undertake a serious change to your physical health and fitness regimen? If you answered yes to any of these, you should schedule an appointment with a medical doctor.</li>
      <li>Don’t let little roadblocks keep you (stay) stuck or make you feel like you can’t progress. Sometimes people in the contemplation stage of change get stuck over little things that are easy to overcome (e.g., you don’t like to run and when you think about having to do a cardio workout at the gym, you only think about the treadmill and running).  Figure out an exercise regimen that doesn’t include running.  It is highly likely that there is an option or alternative that will work for you.</li>
      <li>Don’t let bumps in the road discourage you from reaching your goals. Sometimes when people are faced with unexpected and unfortunate events (a break-up, financial trouble, serious illness or death of a loved one, etc) they feel so consumed by these things that they lose sight of many other important things in their lives. New habits and goals, like starting a new health and fitness routine, would likely be on the top of the list that could be easily pushed to the side. Try your best not to let this happen. Also, keep in mind that exercise is a great way to improve your mood and brighten your spirits! Medical doctors, psychologists, and other professionals often prescribe exercise to people as a way to improve their mood, combat depression and anxiety, and improve well-being. If you are feeling down, upset or stressed, exercise! This will help you feel better emotionally and will also help you toward your health and wellness goals. </li>
      <li>Try to be open-minded. In this stage, you are still ‘on the fence’ about whether or not you really want to put in the effort to make changes. You go back and forth, evaluating the pros and cons. Try to be reasonable, logical, open to feedback from others, and most of all, “don’t knock it before you try it.”</li>
      <li>Create a support team. Discuss your health goals with loved ones, your coach, or others who will be a good support system for you (including friends on social media). For some people, verbalizing their goals to others is a good way to build in some extra personal accountability. Not only will you potentially feel accountable to follow through with your goals, but you will get support and encouragement from people who care about you as you work toward goals. </li>
