    <h1>Building Hope</h1>
    <p>According to the research about hope, successful individuals use six alternative routes to achieve a goal. Keep trying a different route if your goal is blocked!</p>
    <p>Hope is the perception that you have sufficient motivation and a belief in yourself to change something and you can use several paths to accomplish it. When you try one type of problem solving exercise to achieve your goal but you find that it doesn’t work, don’t be afraid to switch to something else. To increase hope, combine high energy with a flexible plan. For example, you having problems with your boss at work or in a relationship that isn’t working, try something different.  Believe that you will be able to have a different outcome. You might not know how to change things at the present time, but you will figure it out! That is hope. </p>

    <h3>Why is it important to build hope with relation to health and fitness?</h3>
    <p>When an individual tries to change a goal or habit, it might be difficult because of lack of knowledge, motivation, or desire. </p>
    <p>High-hope individuals really want to change, set a clear and achievable goal, find at least six paths/routes to the goal, and maintain their motivation by using expert friends, buddies, or other social rewards. They state their goal publicly, ask for assistance, and call a friend if they lose motivation. A key to high hope is the ability to establish daily routines that can be done without thinking. The routine happens daily without the question, “Should I do this today?” For example, a person usually brushes his/her teeth daily, eats daily, and showers daily. To change something to a habit or  a routine, pick a time and do it without thinking about it too much. Remember, it takes 21 days to break a habit but 60 days to establish one.  So keep practicing and doing! Visualize yourself doing the habit or goal you have set for yourself.</p>

    <h4>Why do we lose hope when we try to make a change?</h4>
    <p>Low Hope is Caused by Goal Blockages and Subsequent Negative Reactions</p>
    <p>When your “goal-directed thinking” isn’t producing good results, you can pass through a few psychological stages. Feeling blocked can cause negative reactions, “One of these responses is disappointment, which the person experiences in different ways and in successive stages. These stages are not limited to any particular pattern for all people, but generally they progress from hope to rage, from rage to despair, and from despair to apathy.” 
      <cite>(Snyder et al., 1996)</cite></p>
    <ul>
      <li>RAGE. “When a person experiences rage, which is the very first reaction when profoundly blocked, that person still has energy and drive to pursue alternative goals (albeit not necessarily effectively). People often commit misguided, impulsive, and self-defeating acts while enraged... </li>
      <li>DESPAIR. When in despair, which is the next step in the hypothesized progression, the individual still is focused on a blocked goal, but feels an overwhelming sense of futility about overcoming the related obstacle (or obstacles)...” <cite>(Snyder et al., 1996, pp. 41-42)</cite> </li>
      <li>APATHY. Apathy can be a mind set of indifference when a person perceives a low skill level and a low challenge level. <cite>(Csikszentmihalyi, M., Finding Flow, 1997)</cite></li>

    <h1>TIPS &amp; EXERCISES FOR CHANGE</h1>
    <h3>Try these exercises to build your hope and motivation as you change your daily habits</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Ask family members to help with motivation by reminding you about what you are working on, providing encouragement and complimenting you.</li>
      <li>Think of an obstacle to your goal (“I’m not a morning person”) as a signal that you have the wrong strategy of exercising in the morning—not that you are unmotivated or lazy. Exercise in the evening! Find a different path to your goal.</li>
      <li>Recall a time when you were successful in changing something. What were you doing differently? What was motivating you? </li>
      <li>Read stories about people who have made changes in their lives. What similarities do you have with those people?</li>
      <li>Laugh at yourself and think of fun ways to change your habit. Laughter is great therapy!</li>
      <li>Make a public statement and put it on your blog or Facebook. Talk about succeeding and tell everyone you know about your new plan.</li>
      <li>Find a mentor or someone who is an expert at what you want to change in your life. Spend time with them and observe their actions. Interview them on how they got where they are.</li>
      <li>Reward yourself with a fun activity when you achieve part of a goal.</li>
      <li>Visualize yourself when you have achieved the goal. Use the 5 senses. This makes it more real and your brain can’t tell the difference between visualization and reality. </li>
      <li>Motivation is sustained by getting enough sleep and lowering stress. </li>
      <li>Motivation theory suggests that you won’t do anything unless you believe you can do it. Believe in yourself!!!</li>
