    <h1>Emotional Eating</h1>
    <p>Disconnected eating is when we eat but we’re not hungry at prescribed meal times or we continue to eat even when we feel full. It is often associated with emotions such as rejection, anxiety, and fear. Studies have shown that young girls who feel anxiety often mistake this feeling for hunger. In addition, disconnected eating often results from dieting. When a person is starving, it’s difficult to control binges when food becomes available. If a person consistently eats beyond a feeling of fullness, weight gain becomes an issue. “Emotional” eating is when food is used as a comfort or a distraction from emotions: “Eating in response to emotions interferes with the body’s natural physical cues of hunger, fullness, appetite, and satiety” (Kratina, King, and Hayes, 1999).</p>
    
    <p>Regular dieting seems to increase disconnected or emotional eating considerably. The following problems appear when an individual is always on a diet (Kratina, King, and Hayes, 1999):</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>“Preoccupation with food,</li>
      <li>hunger intolerance,</li>
      <li>overeating or binge eating,</li>
      <li>eating in response to emotions,</li>
      <li>weight gain… the absolute opposite of the results the individual wanted.”</li>

    <h1>Exercise Resistance</h1>
    <p>“Exercise resistance” is a term used to explain why individuals may not want to move their bodies: ”</p>
     
    <ul>
      <li>“As a child, they were picked last by teams and felt rejected </li>
      <li>Growing up, they felt extreme pressure to perform from their parents, physical education teachers or coaches. Or, they had perfectionistic tendencies… </li>
      <li>They were repeatedly pushed into exercise </li>
      <li>They felt pain and rejection when someone berated their bodies </li>
      <li>They felt pain and rejection when someone berated their bodies </li>
      <li>They exercised only when dieting, when their energy was low </li>
      <li>They exercise only when they diet to lose weight </li>
      <li>They start exercise with an all or nothing attitude </li>
      <li>They attempt an exercise program, but do not understand how to do the exercises </li>
      <li>They try to make time for exercise but feel overwhelmed by the demands of life </li>
      <li>They use exercise as an external measure of self-worth </li>
      <li>They feel rejection from a friend, family or society, believing the rejection is due to the size/shape of their bodies… [and] then use exercise to change their body </li>
      <li>They feel rejection from a friend, family or society, believing the rejection is due to the size/shape of their bodies… [and] then use exercise to change their body </li>
      <li>They experienced sexual abuse. Moving the body can bring up body memories of the abuse. Exercise can trigger flashbacks of repressed abuse…” </li>
    </ul>
