    <h1>Body Image</h1>
    <p>Body image is a complex, multidimensional phenomenon consisting of one’s attitudes, perceptions, behaviors, and experiences pertaining to one’s own physical appearance. It includes: how you see yourself when you look in the mirror or when you picture yourself in your mind; what you believe about your own appearance (including your memories, assumptions, and generalizations); how you feel about your body including your height, shape, and weight; how you sense and control you body as you move and how you feel in your body, not just how you feel about your body. Negative or poor body image can include a distorted perception of your body shape (e.g., you perceive parts of your body unlike they really are); you are convinced that only other people are attractive and that your body size or shape is a sign of personal failure; you feel ashamed, self-conscious, and anxious about your body; and you feel uncomfortable and awkward in your body. Body image is often closely tied to self-esteem.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important to understand body image with relation to health and fitness?</h3>
    <p>With a positive or healthy body image, a person has a real and accurate perception of their size and shape and feels comfortable in their body. With a negative body image, a person has a distorted perception of their shape and size, compares their body to others, and feels shame and anxiety about their body. Being unhappy with your body can affect how you think and feel about yourself as a person. A poor body image can lead to emotional distress, low self-esteem, unhealthy dieting and exercise habits, anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. Developing a positive body image and a healthy mental attitude is crucial to happiness and wellness. Developing a positive body image will also help you to maintain long-term results with respect to health and fitness.</p>

    <h1>TIPS &amp; EXERCISES</h1>
    <h3>Some tips on how to manage and improve poor body image</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Positive self-talk. Positive self-talk means thinking to yourself or even saying out loud positive affirmations about your body. This can be just simply about your body or you can relate it to the progress you have made toward your health and fitness goals. Do not give into negative self-talk…keep positive! Instead of focusing on all of the negative things you feel about yourself and your body, focus on all of your positive attributes.</li>
      <li>Accept weight variations throughout the life cycle. It is perfectly normal for people to gain and lose weight throughout their lives. Don’t let this become overly discouraging.</li>
      <li>Work toward self-acceptance and self-forgiveness. Be gentle and kind to yourself. Focus on your strengths.</li>
      <li>Accept yourself—and your body. Keep in mind that acceptance does not mean approval. Accepting yourself and your body does not mean you are going to sit back and do nothing to change it; however, it gives you much more control and power to make the changes you want. When we are caught up in denial or misery about our bodies (or anything else) it is easy to feel overwhelmed, stuck, and unsure how to proceed. We often have little faith that we can succeed in making positive changes when we do not approach change from a place of acceptance.</li>
      <li>Work to correct any “thinking errors” you may have. Thinking errors are those thoughts that are not entirely (or sometimes at all) accurate—these can stem from negative self-talk, poor self esteem and body image, over exaggeration of problems or flaws, perfectionism and other things. To change these sorts of thoughts one must openly and honestly evaluate the situation and evaluate your body (height, weight, shape, size, etc.). What thoughts do you have about your body? When you take a step back and try to non-judgmentally evaluate your body, what do you see?

      </li>
      <li>Many of us judge each of our body parts individually (e.g., “my thighs are too fat,” “my breasts are too droopy,” etc). Try to experience your body as a whole, rather than as separate parts that need improvement.</li>
      <li>Instead of trying to conform to the rigid (and often unrealistic) body/beauty ideals promoted in the popular media, experiment with finding a style or look that expresses yourself and feels good to you.</li>
      <li>When you exercise, pay attention to the rhythms and sensations you experience as you move. While exercise is often promoted as a way to lose weight and achieve an idealized body shape, it also often helps us feel good in our bodies, which in turn can help us accept and even celebrate how we look.</li>
      <li>Notice how much time you spend worrying about your looks instead of being aware of what is going on inside of you or around you. Try practicing mindfulness, a technique used in meditation and yoga to more effectively and appropriately consider your body. 
      <br />
      Try not to spend too much time focused on your body and body image. There are so many other, more fun things to spend your time doing. Decide how you wish to spend your time and energy—pursuing the “perfect body image” or enjoying family, friends, work, school, hobbies, travel and other important things in your life. Remember, how we spend our days is how we spend our lives. Are you spending your days like you want to?
      </li>
      <li>Give up all media for a week. Forego reading magazines (especially fashion and fitness magazines!), watching television, or surfing the Internet. When you get the urge to grab the remote, or pick up a magazine, go for a walk or chat with a friend. At the end of the week, see if you feel different about yourself.</li>
      <li>Kill your “inner supermodel.” If you have an image of perfection in your head to which you’re constantly comparing yourself, get rid of it. You think your nose is too big? Your hips are too fat? Your biceps are not big enough? Compared to whose? You consider your stretch marks or scars “flaws”? Where is it written that our bodies should be free of lines or marks or scars? Such bodies do not exist in real life. Focus on being healthy and fit, rather than like a supermodel. There is often a considerable difference between what a trainer or physician would say is a healthy body than what magazines would say.</li>
