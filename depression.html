    <h1>Depression</h1>
    <p>Depression is the most common psychological disorder in the world.  Two thirds of people who see a doctor are suffering with some form of depression or anxiety.  Depression affects your mood, thoughts, feelings, behavior, and overall health and well-being. Everyone has “bad days” or days of feeling sad and down, but generally these feelings last only a day or two and go away. Depression goes far beyond just feeling sad, “down” or “blue” for a few days; it is a period of prolonged sadness, feeling down, and often feeling hopeless and helpless.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important to understand depression with relation to health and well-being?</h3>
    <p>Depression can take a serious toll on a person’s health. People may not take care of themselves as well as usual in terms of diet/nutrition, exercise, hygiene, and/or medical care. Additionally, depression is often accompanied by poor sleep, which isn’t good for health. Depression can influence appetite. Some people will experience a decreased appetite and lose weight quickly, but in an unhealthy manner. Others may have an increased appetite as they use food as a coping mechanism or to make themselves feel better. This can be especially defeating for those who are feeling depression about their health, weight, and/or fitness level. Those who are depressed often feel little interest, motivation or energy to do things which then increases the depression. </p>

    <h1>TIPS &amp; EXERCISES</h1>
    <h3>Some tips on how to manage depression</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Try to be positive about your life. Acknowledge your accomplishments and be proud of them! You are doing good work.</li>
      <li>Exercise.  Know that when you are exercising, you are not only working toward your health and fitness goals, but also elevating your mood and improving your depressive symptoms. Mental health professionals sometimes “prescribe” exercise to clients with depression because research shows it is an effective tool at elevating mood.</li>
      <li>Stay in the Present. Remind yourself that what you are doing now is what matters and that history does not have to repeat itself. People with depression often focus on past failures (real or perceived) and feel sad and guilty about these (e.g., relationships that haven’t worked, businesses that have failed, initial successful weight loss followed by weight gain) and let these feelings get in the way of future successes.</li>
      <li>Stay positive and don’t lose hope. Try to push your negative thoughts away and focus your attention on the positive things you are doing to work toward your goals. Don’t let yourself get caught in small bumps in the road (e.g., getting turned down for a date, smoking a few cigarettes). Also, work to incorporate more positive events into your life. These don’t have to be monumental things (e.g., a month tour or Europe, buying a new car), but can be seemingly small, but powerful things (e.g., 30 minutes of your favorite TV show, listening to music you enjoy, putting clean sheets on your bed, having a hot bath, a phone call with a loved one). These small things are critical as they are easy to do, usually relatively inexpensive, and reap big rewards. </li>
      <li>Review your goals and expectations. Discuss these in detail with a loved one and break them down into small, manageable pieces. People with depression often experience low energy and low motivation, loss of interest, and fatigue, and can become easily overwhelmed with tasks that seem like they will require a large amount of effort. Approach your goals with a “baby-step” perspective. Don’t worry about taking things slowly or doing “just a little bit” each day; just a little bit is an excellent starting place. It’s better to start small and work your way up, than to start out at 200% and get burnt out and overwhelmed and quit.</li>
      <li>Incorporate good things into your life. Think about small things that you could incorporate into your daily routine that make you feel happy (e.g., having an i-pod with songs you love, talking with a loved one, wear your favorite outfit). Any and all small activities than can make the tasks of changing your life less daunting and overwhelming are good things.</li>
      <li>Look for Patterns. Pay attention to your depressive symptoms and look for patterns. Many people feel worse at certain times of the day. If you notice that you feel better or worse at certain times of the day, work around these. If you feel worse in the mornings, don’t’ do the “heavy lifting” or hard activities at this time. Schedule hard things or things that take a lot of brain power in the afternoon and evening so it won’t be quite so challenging to attend to them.</li>
      <li>Try journaling. Journaling is a good way of venting and purging all the stressors and negative thoughts and feelings you may be experiencing. It can also serve as a place you can write about your goals and accomplishments. </li>
      <li>Enlist a Support Group. Get help and support for your depression. You can talk to family and friends, your doctor, or your religious leader. If you are uncomfortable talking to these people or feel that your depression is too bad, engage in counseling. There are many effective treatments for depression including a variety of talk therapies, group therapies and medications.</li>
      <li>Read the gratitude module.</li>
