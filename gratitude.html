    <h1>Gratitude</h1>
    <p>By noticing our feelings of appreciation and cultivating an attitude or gratefulness for the good in our lives regularly, we can replace much of the negativity (resentment, envy, bitterness, greed) that leads us to feel bad about ourselves and our lives. When we recognize that goodness often comes from a source outside of ourselves, we feel more satisfaction and, in turn, want to share with others. When we want what we have and acknowledge the good that others have brought into our lives, we feel better and often become less materialistic and envious of others. After practicing gratitude mindfully each day, you find that you have enough.</p>

    <h3>Why is it important to understand gratitude with relation to health and fitness?</h3>
    <p>By noticing our feelings of appreciation and cultivating an attitude or gratefulness for the good in our lives regularly, we can replace much of the negativity (resentment, envy, bitterness, greed) that leads us to feel bad about ourselves and our lives.

    <p>In a gratitude study conducted by Emmons & McCullough, participants in a gratitude condition who wrote once each week for 10 weeks about “five things they were grateful for that had occurred during the past week” experienced the following improvements listed below. </p>

    <h4>According to Emmons (2007), the gratitude participants:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>“felt better about their lives as a whole” </li>
      <li>“felt better about their lives as a whole” </li>
      <li>“reported fewer health complaints” </li>
      <li>“spent significantly more time exercising (nearly 1.5 hours more per week) than those in the hassles condition.” </li>
    </ul>    
    <p>Studies conducted after 911 also showed that even in tragedy, gratitude interventions can be beneficial. Those individuals who lost loved ones in this tragedy who were grateful for the time spent with them, or grateful for little things about their loved one, or thought about their lives in a positive way recovered from grieving twice as fast as those who dwelt on the negative aspects.</p>
    <p>In addition, studies have shown that you feel better about yourself if you are grateful and show this gratitude to others that have touched your life in some way.</p>

    <h1>Strategies for Change</h1>
    <h3>Try these exercises to build more gratitude into your daily life</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Write a list of things you take for granted. Every day, add a few items to your list.</li>
      <li>Identify two people each day who have helped make your life better. These people could be teachers, coaches, parents, grandparents, ministers, or friends. Every day, add a few names to your list.</li>
      <li>Once a week, write a letter to one of the people on your list and read it to him or her during a short visit. If you can’t visit in person, arrange a Skype visit or call and read your letter over the phone.</li>
      <li>Each week, write about challenging aspects of your life but focus only on the blessings that have come from trying to deal with those challenges. If you practice finding blessings in negative situations, you’ll increase your feelings of gratitude in trying times.</li>
      <li>Each week, write a paragraph about a happy time in your life and identify an individual who helped make it a wonderful event. You could write them a letter or email and tell them how they have impacted your life. </li>
      <li>Write a paragraph about an unhappy time in your life and identify someone who helped you. After writing a paragraph, talk to a close relative about the event for 5-10 minutes and record your thoughts and impressions.</li>
      <li>While walking, practice meditating on your blessings. Take time to look around you and notice the beauties in nature.</li>
      <li>Create “over-learned” routines that you do automatically. Go to bed at a certain time and meditate for 5 minutes. Think about your day by reviewing everything that went well or only the times when you felt happy or peaceful feelings. If you think of something negative, skip it and search again for the peaceful moments. You will retrain your mind to focus on peacefulness rather than unhappiness.</li>
    </ol>
