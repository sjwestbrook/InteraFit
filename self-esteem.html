    <h1>Self-Esteem</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Of all the judgments we pass in life, none is as important as the one we pass on ourselves.</p>
      <p>Self-esteem is the disposition to experience oneself as competent to cope with the basic challenges of life and as worthy of happiness.</p>
      <cite>Nathanial Brandon</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Despite the many books, articles, and seminars devoted to the subject of self-esteem, there has been little consensus or agreement about its definition. However, without self-esteem or self love life is not as satisfying. Self-esteem has two essential components:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>LIVING CONSCIOUSLY: Awareness of everything that has an influence on our actions, purposes, values, and goals – and to act to the best of our ability in accordance with that which we see and know. </li>
      <li>SELF-RESPECT: The belief that we deserve happiness, achievement and love. We value ourselves and we do not allow others to harm or abuse us in any way. Self-respect makes it possible to have relationships with others.</li>
      <li>SELF-ASSERTIVENESS:  Means knowing what I need, want and value; honoring these and fulfilling these in one’s life.</li>
      <li>SELF-RESPONSIBILITY: To take responsibility for your life and well-being. This means understanding that the only thing you can control in your life is “YOU” and others cannot control you only to the extent you allow them to. So there is no blaming of others.</li>
      <li>SELF-ACCEPTANCE:  The ability to like yourself unconditionally and not be in denial of your good or bad characteristics. Self-acceptance is a refusal to be in an adversarial relationship with yourself. </li>
      <li>LIVING WITH INTGRITY:  To live with purpose and meaning in such as way that you are true to your values, convictions, standards and beliefs. </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The way we feel about ourselves determines how we treat others and ourselves. Self-esteem is reinforcing. When we feel good about ourselves, we act like it, which then reinforces our good feelings. The result is that we succeed more often than we fail. Our expectations for ourselves Increase and we have more motivation to be actively engaged in life. We have more confidence. If we lack confidence, we give up easily, fail more often and aspire to less. The result is we get less of what we want.</p>
    <p>Self-esteem has to do with what you think of you and not what anyone else thinks of you. And even though accomplishments are very important and in some sense are indicative of our character and personality, we are not our accomplishments.</p>
    <p>Take for example this story. A psychologist was working with one of her clients and upon meeting him for the first time, she asked him to describe himself. He proceeded to say “Oh, I’m on the board of regents of a local university; I’m vice-president of a local company; I’ve won this award and that award”. The therapist stopped him and said, “Those are nice accomplishments but if you take them away, does that mean you’re nothing?” He wasn’t his accomplishments. He was able to accomplish because he had certain strengths. He was probably organized, a good people person and had vision. His strengths then determined in large part what his interests were. He was interested in leadership and that was evident in his accomplishments. When reviewing our lives, it is very important to define ourselves in terms of our being strengths and not just doing strengths, as well as, our interests and abilities.</p>
    <p>Life is a process and so is the development of self-esteem or love for oneself. It is not a quick or easy process.</p>

    <h4>Why is it important to understand self-esteem in relation to health and wellness?</h4>
    <p>People, who lack a healthy respect or love for themselves, usually engage in self-defeating behaviors or those activities which do not promote physical and emotional health. They may engage in destructive behaviors such as chemical dependency or other addictive activities or they may not be motivated to engage in life. They may have feelings that they are not adequate or “good enough”. People with low self-esteem tend to sabotage their lives. They may have a good job but believe that others are going to “see them as they really are” and they believe that they will eventually lose their jobs. They then go about helping that process by engaging in self-fulfilling prophecies such as being late, arguing with their boss or other sabotaging behaviors. People with low self esteem generally do not look at life in a positive way, may be depressed or anxious, and may have little motivation to change. With regard to health and fitness, lack of motivation generalizes to this realm. They may not have the desire or energy to improve their health. These individuals may engage in behaviors such as binging or emotional eating and may have a poor sense of their body image. Most people with a poor self-concept are in the pre-contemplation or contemplation stage of change. These individuals have little desire or energy to change.</p>

    <h1>STRATEGIES FOR CHANGE</h1>
    <h3>Some tips on how to improve your self-esteem, self-love, and self-respect</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Get to know you <br />
        To love anyone, it is necessary that we get to know them. We don’t love people that we don’t know. This means getting to know their strengths, their weaknesses, values, beliefs etc. This pertains to self-love as well. Many times we “sleepwalk” through life. We aren’t aware of who we are, what we need, or what we believe.
        <ul>
          <li>Write down your strengths in 5 areas: social, physical, educational/career, spiritual (not religious), and individual (hobbies, general strengths that don’t fit into the other categories). Make sure these strengths are your core strengths and have nothing to do with what you accomplish. Then write down your weaknesses. Focus on your strengths and how these will help you with your goals. i.e. You may have the strength of persistence. You will then focus on this and realize that even though you don’t see results in changing yourself immediately, you keep going and persist.</li>
          <li>Write down your values and beliefs about life and relate these to your goals. For example, you may value hard work. Define what this means to you and set goals that will help you be work hard in all areas your life. </li>
          <li>Write down the messages that you send to yourself and relate these to your goals. i.e. I will be successful at whatever I do and this applies to the my job vs. I will never be successful and I know I will never excel in my job. You need to change the negative messages that you send to yourself. You can do this by first being aware of these messages and then replacing them with other positive messages.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>Unconditionally Accept Yourself <br />
        If we really want to love someone, we unconditionally accept them for who they are–weaknesses, needs and all. We might not like some of the things that they do, but if we don’t accept them, we don’t love them. If we love their potential or who they could become, we don’t love them, we love their potential. This doesn’t mean that we like everything the other person does but we accept it as part of them. This applies, to self-love. You may not like everything you do, but you need to be willing to look at yourself HONESTLY and take responsibility for who you are and where you are at in life. That means you can’t blame others for your mistakes or inadequacies. If you don’t take responsibility, you give up your freedom and self-control. <br />
        In addition, you should learn to be self-compassionate. This involves being open to your own suffering, not avoiding or disconnecting from it, and having the desire to heal your suffering. Self-compassion also involves offering nonjudgmental understanding of your pain, inadequacies, and failures.
        <ul>
          <li>Write down some of the things you are doing to sabotage change in your life. </li>
          <li>Write down some of the things you have tried in the past that have not worked for you with regard to change. </li>
          <li>After writing down your strengths and weaknesses, go over these. Which strengths or weaknesses do you find it hard to accept in yourself?</li>
          <li>Decide on one thing that you want to change in your life and set specific goals on how you are going to make that change. Make sure these goals are specific and you can measure them. Tell someone about your new goals – preferably someone who will help you with accountability. Decide how to use your strengths to make this change in your life. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      
      <li>The last thing we do if we really want to learn to love someone is to do for them. We don’t love a person because they do for us; we love them because we sacrifice and do for them. We help them meet their needs. A mother’s love is a good example of this. In addition, people who like themselves and who are happy live with integrity. They decide what they want and they assertively go after it. This means they respect other’s needs and allow them the freedom to be who they are without coercion or manipulation and they also understand their own needs. They respect themselves enough to not let others control their behaviors. If we live a life true to ourselves, or in other words we are motivated from within instead of being what others want us to be, we will live with integrity. If not, we will suffer despair. <cite>(Erikson, 1956)</cite> 
        <ul>
          <li>After you review your needs, set goals on how you are going to meet them. Discuss these with someone you trust or your coach, physician, therapist. Make sure these goals are yours, and are motivated from within.</li>
          <li>How can you enlist other’s help in meeting your needs and goals? </li>
          <li>Do some introspective work. Are you living with integrity in all areas of your life?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
